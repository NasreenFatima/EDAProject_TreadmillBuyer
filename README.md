## Introduction:
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target
audience for each type of treadmill oƯered by the company, to provide a better
recommendation of the treadmills to new customers. The team decides to investigate
whether there are diƯerences across the product with respect to customer
characteristics.
## Data Description:
The company collected data on individuals who purchased a treadmill from the AeroFit
stores during the prior three months. The dataset in aerofit_treadmill_data.csv has the
following features:
1 Product - product purchased: KP281, KP481, or KP781
2 Age - in years
3 Gender - male/female
4 Education - in years
5 MaritalStatus - single or partnered
6 Usage - the average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill
each week
7 Fitness - self-rated fitness on a 1-5 scale, where 1 is the poor shape and 5 is the
excellent shape
8 Income - annual income in US dollars
9 Miles - the average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week

## Analyze:
1. From my first analyzation I saw that age group 20-29 frequently appear which shows
that this age group purchase more treadmill from the Aerofit.
2. Customers with 16 years of education and have partnered buy treadmill more as
compared to rest.
3. Product KP281 was purchased more as compared to rest of products in both
genders.
4. Product KP281 buy frequently by the age group of 20-29.
5. Miles with usage and fitness show positive correlation.
6. There are different number of outliers in each column.
